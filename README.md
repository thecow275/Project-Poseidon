**A CraftBukkit CB1060 fork for Beta 1.7.3 fixing bugs and adding basic features.<br>**

## Features
This is a non-exhaustive list of features that Project Poseidon includes:

- **UUID Support:** Settings to enable UUID-based inventories alongside methods for plugins to transition to UUID-based systems similar to modern Minecraft server implementations.
- **Poseidon Watchdog Implementation:** An automatic utility for detecting server hangs, ending the server process, and providing diagnostics to fix the underlying issues.
- **Packet Events:** Adds packet send and receive events for advanced plugin development without needing Spout or to use Reflections that are incompatible with modern Java versions.
- **Inventory Block Duplication Fixes:** Includes fixes for chest, furnace, inventory block duplication, and Minecart duplication issues.
- **Cross-World Duplication Fix:** Fixes a cross-world duplication glitch.
- **Duplication Glitch Fix:** Fix a bug with the Bukkit chunk cache which allowed users to duplicate and get unobtainable items.
- **Server Crash Fix:** Addresses multiple server crash issues.
- **Connection Pauses:** A powerful feature allowing developers to retrieve information asynchronously before a player connects.
- **Event Handlers:** Modern event handlers backported to facilitating easier coding, plugin backporting, and early release plugin support.
- **Vanish API Backport:** Backports the modern vanish API for easy vanish plugin creation and fixes issues with hacking players seeing vanished players.
- **Logging Enhancements:** Adds an option for daily log file creation and logs player commands to the console, with exceptions for Authme, XAuth, and similar plugins.
- **TPS API and Command:** Adds a TPS command and API for plugins to access historical TPS data.
- **Server Shutdown Improvements:** Enhances server shutdown procedures to ensure world/player data and plugin data are properly saved.
- **Release2Beta Support:** Added support for Release2Beta, including IP Forwarding.
- **Tree Growth Blockage Settings:** Allows server owners to block tree growth from replacing certain blocks to prevent griefing.
- **TCP NoDelay Option:** Improves netcode performance for compatible clients.
- **Ragequit/Ragejoin Fixes:** Prevents ragequit and ragejoin connection/chat spam.
- **Plugin Hiding:** Allows plugins to be hidden from the server list via an attribute in `plugin.yml`.
- **Improve Console Debug:** Make multiple common errors less verbose in the console.
- **Event Handling Improvements:** Ensures primed TNT fires the correct event and backports the explosion event from modern Bukkit.
- **Spawn Location Options:** Provides options to disable spawn location randomization and teleportation to the highest safe block on join.
- **Configurable Mob Spawner Area Limit:** Allows server owners to set a mob-cap for mob spawners to prevent mob farms from causing extreme lag.
